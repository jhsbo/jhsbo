## Hey there! 👋

I'm Jhonas Boeno, a software developer based in Brazil 🇧🇷.

### At Work 🏢

I currently work as a Systems Analyst at [Banrisul](https://www.banrisul.com.br), a state-owned bank in Rio Grande do Sul. My focus is on developing and maintaining the essential, core tools that power other developers' work. 🛠️ I write predictable, maintainable, and reliable code for critical functionalities, like calculating verification digits and business dates. These components form the solid foundation that supports the bank's modern, customer-facing applications. 💪

### On the Side 🚀

In my personal projects, I love to explore and experiment with different technologies. It's my playground for learning and having fun with code! Here are a few technologies I enjoy working with:

- ![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node%2Ejs-5FA04E?style=flat&logo=nodedotjs&logoColor=white)
- ![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C++-00599C?style=flat&logo=cplusplus&logoColor=white)
- ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/-React-61DAFB?style=flat&logo=react&logoColor=black)
- ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=flat&logo=javascript&logoColor=black)

### Off the Clock  hobbies

When I'm not coding, you can find me playing the piano 🎹, or diving into games 🎮, movies 🎬, and series 📺.
